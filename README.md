# Transfer Learning for Application Classification in Network Traffic Data

## Project Goals & Objectives
This project is aimed at classifying applications in 3 types of network traffic flows (regular; VPN; TOR). The purpose of this project is to investigate the effectiveness of transfer learning in the classification of application traffic when a model is applied to previously unseen data.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project is an augmented labeled dataset which contains data from ISCX VPN-nonVPN traffic dataset (ISCX-VPN), ISCX Tor-nonTor dataset (ISCX-Tor) and a small packet capture (TAU). This dataset was introduced by T. Shapira and Y. Shavitt in  "FlowPic: A Generic Representation for Encrypted Traffic Classification and Applications Identification," in IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management.
